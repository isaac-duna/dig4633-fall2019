## VR Lab: TITLE HERE

On 9/10/19 I tried VR for the first time using the Oculus Quest on campus. It was far more of an incredible experience than I had anticipated it to be. Something that really impressed me was the responsiveness and feedback the controllers gave you when using your hands for the virtual activities.

## VR Lab: 1

My intent behind the design decision is attributed to being in a farm and when the farmers would use wagons pulled by livestock to transport their crops. In a busy farm with much produce, the player must have its form of transportation to sell the product they've grown. In order to successfully complete the task, the player must pick up and attach the wheels to the bottom four corners of the wagon-like cube.

## VR Lab: 2

My intention for making the software to allow you to place and click car(s) in your driveway is practical to see how a car would look infront of your house before you buy it. Some people may use the app in order to see what it would be like to have a luxury car sitting right ontop  of your driveway. Idealistically you can put any car you want and then screenshot the picture.
